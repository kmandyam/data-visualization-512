With this visualization, we aim to answer the question: how do the hours of sunshine in Seattle compare to the hours of sunshine in different cities around the US throughout the year? In order to answer this question, we must first determine how to visualize hours of sunshine in each month. The natural decision might be to introduce a scatter plot with the x-axis being month and the y-axis being the hours of sunshine. However, we argue that a line graph is more effective in answering our question than a scatter plot. Note that the hours of sunshine reported in the dataset are merely the average amount for the month. Since our goal is to compare the general trend of sunshine between cities, it’s more effective if the visualization is continuous rather than discrete and the line graph allows us to interpolate between the fixed data points. 

We continue our analysis with a discussion of encoding channels for each data type. “Hours of sunshine” is a quantitative (ratio) value, and we choose to encode it as the x-axis of our plot. It makes sense to say that if a city received 4 hours of sunshine and another city received 8 hours of sunshine, the latter city received twice as much sunshine. “Months” is a temporal data type, but we’ve chosen to encode it as a quantitative amount (i.e. with month numbers), as the y-axis of the plot. This allows us to compare hours of sunshine in each city for a given month. It also allows us to visualize the data over the course of a year, because we’ve segmented the year into 12 even parts, which is part of our guiding question. In order to show the hours of sunshine per month for all cities, we plot several lines on the same graph. We encode these lines with different colors, to visually distinguish them. 

Most importantly, we choose to encode data about Seattle in a slightly different way than data about the other cities. Note that lines corresponding to other cities are slightly thinner and less opaque than the line corresponding to Seattle. This allows us to more clearly see how Seattle stacks up when compared to the other cities, which is in alignment with our guiding question. 

Not much about the data is obscured due to the visual design of this graphic. However, we have chosen to omit geographical data about these cities. Perhaps encoding information about city location relative to equator would answer the question “why do the hours of sunshine in each city differ?”. While this isn’t the same question as the one we’re trying to answer above, right now, the visual assumes that all cities are somewhat “equal” aside from the fact that they all have different patterns of sunshine. Scientifically, we know that hours of sunshine depends on latitude and general geographic location, so encoding that information might present a more complete picture.
